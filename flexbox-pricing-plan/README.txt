 Best viewed with editors to left or right.

Working on using flexbox to display pricing plans with varying heights of content, with nice transitions, and mostly just using CSS. Very minimal JS for an optional piece of data. Also, using media queries to stack items when the boxes become too narrow.

TODO:
COMMENT CODE,
IE Testing,
Decide if prices should be centered. (effects design, not functionality),
Adding "best choice" or some other item to showcase one of the options,
Fix weird choppy slideDown for when "more options" is clicked
Decide to hide "more options" as it is now, or always expose this information.
